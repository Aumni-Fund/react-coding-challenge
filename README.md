# Aumni Frontend Coding Challenge
The purpose of this coding challenge is to gauge knowledge in React and JavaScript. In the coding challenge, you will build a React application that displays a very small subset of our domain at Aumni. Below you will find some helpful terminology to help you understand what these domain-specific terms mean.

## Terminology
- **Fund** - A Fund is a type of [Investment Vehicle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentvehicle.asp) that invests the money that it has raised into various **Companies**.
- **Company** - A Company that a **Fund** invests in. Traditionally called a Portfolio Company from the perspective of the **Fund**. This is typically a start-up company that is trying to raise money.

## Setup/Notes
1. Clone/Download this repository. This is a default Create React Application.

2. Make your first commit by filling out the `code-challenge-notes.md` file in the root of this directory.

3. Once you have made your first commit you will have 72 hours to make your final commit to complete the code challenge.

4. Please do **NOT** push your code challenge solution to a public repository.

5. This is a frontend coding challenge. Please do **NOT** spend your time building out any kind of backend service.

6. You are allowed to install and use third-party packages.

## Getting Started
1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

2. Run `yarn start` to start the application. The default URL and Port is `http://localhost:3000`.
   
## Base JSON Data
You will find mock JSON data in the `src/mocks` directory of this project.

## Goals
- [ ] Develop some way to visualize the mock data easily (Table, List, Etc...).
- [ ] Your solution showcases your CSS styling skills.

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Calculate a fund's multiple (Hint: This calculation is derived from the `impliedValue` and `cost` data points in the mocks).
- [ ] Implement some type of routing solution to view a specific fund/company data.
- [ ] We are starting to use visualizations to show this type of data in our real product. 
      It would be cool to see you implement some visualizations from the mock data provided.
- [ ] Modify/Add to the mock data to create a more interesting/rich experience.
  
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] You have filled out the _required_ parts of the `code-challenge-notes.md` and made your first commit.
- [ ] The code is well organized.
- [ ] The code follows React/JavaScript best practices.
- [ ] The code has good test coverage.
- [ ] Your Git commit history is clean and meaningful.

## Submission
1. Zip your project up.

2. Upload your zip to http://file.io using the "Upload" button or the `cURL` commands

3. Email the file download URL to [Aumni Eng Recruiting](mailto:eng-recruiting@aumni.fund)
